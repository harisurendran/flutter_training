<h2>Stateless Widgets</h2>

<p>
There is no state to manage in Stateless widgets. In other words, the state does not change. The screen is stateless and displays the same throughout its life cycle. You can think of the state as data that the screen displays. If the data changes, then the screen needs to refresh and display the new data.</p>

<p>
In the code, we have four variables that could be considered as a state. Color1, color2, sentence1 and sentence2. They never change; there is nothing in the code that reflects any other value. Note also that they are constants. Therefore this is a use case for Stateless widget. In later examples, we will show how we can use other state management techniques to change them.</p>
<p>
When we need to change the color or the sentence in response to a user or system action, then we need stateful widgets. This concept is covered in the next section.</p>
